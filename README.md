# Customers in a *box*
Code Sample to simulate customers movement (dot trajectory) in a retail store

- Simulating the trajectory of a customer in a rectanglar retail store 10 x 8 2D space
- Entry point: seafoam green
- Exit zone: pale pink
- A customer (as the green dot) enters the retail store from the entry point and left from the exit zone.
- To do (future improvement):
  - Dot movement: more realistic as human behavior, current implementation is more like rigid particle bounding in a confined space
  - Dot interaction: to emulate customer - customer interaction, customer - employee interaction, customer - signage interaction
  - Add floor plan and obstacles (store shelves, furnitures, etc.)
