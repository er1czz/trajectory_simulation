# trajectory_simulation
Code Sample to simulate trajectory data of customers in a retail store

- Simulating a dot (customer) in a rectanglar retail store 10 x 8
- Entry (point): seafoam green
- Exit (zone): pale pink
- A customer (as a green dot) will enter the retail store from the entry point at coordinate (0.5, 6). Tracking will be ended once the customer moved to the exit zone.
